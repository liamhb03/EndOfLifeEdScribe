<h2>Ox Foundation Solutions Scholarship Contest 2022</h2>
<p>Since Junior year in high school, I have worked as a legal assistant in an estate planning law firm. I have seen firsthand the importance of maintaining a house or property over the years, not only for the tenants' safety but for the legalities involved. Often neglected, but vitally important, are issues such as foundation cracks, mold, and dust mites.</p>
  <p>
    Homeowners owe tenants a duty to keep their property in a habitable condition. This means that the property must be free of dangerous conditions which could cause injury or illness. Foundation cracks, for example, can lead to serious structural problems if not fixed in a timely manner. Mold can cause respiratory problems, and dust mites can trigger allergies.
  </p>
  <p>
    While some maintenance issues may seem minor, they can quickly become major problems if left unchecked. It is important to take care of them as soon as possible to avoid expensive repairs or, worse, putting tenants' safety at risk. The cost of maintaining a property is often much less than the cost of repairing or replacing damaged items.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the safety of tenants, there are other legal implications to consider as well. Most leases include a clause requiring the landlord to keep the property in good repair. If the landlord fails to do so, the tenant may have a legal claim against the landlord. Additionally, if someone is injured on the property due to the landlord's negligence, the landlord could be liable for damages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maintaining a property is not only important for safety and legal reasons, but it also makes good financial sense. By taking care of problems as they arise, landlords can avoid costly repairs down the road. Additionally, well-maintained properties tend to be more valuable than those that are not.
  </p>
  <p>
    Investing in regular maintenance will pay off in the long run, both in terms of the safety of tenants and the financial health of the property.
